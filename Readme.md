# Old SD firstpasser

This is an extension for [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) which adds selectable txt2img and img2img script, which firstpasses image with SD 1.x model. It is useful if you want to use Loras, Embeddings, ControlNet etc made for SD 1.x inside SDXL very much. If SD 3 is released, I will add SDXL firstpassing support too

Hires fix is supported

For quick access to SD 1.x loras in SDXL I recommend to add `lora_show_all` in the quick settings

Inspired by [XAdapter](https://github.com/showlab/X-Adapter), which [also just firstpasses generation with SD 1.5](https://github.com/showlab/X-Adapter/issues/25)
